### Definitions <a id="definitions"></a>

* SNARK - succinct proof that certain statement is true
    * (aka Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge)

### Goals <a id="goals"></a>

* Goal 
    * Short proof (only a few kB size)
    * Fast proof verification (in a few ms)

### Examples <a id="examples"></a>

* SNARK 
    * Examples
        * I know what a message m is
        * I want to proof to verifier that I know m by using a SNARK
        * I will use a SNARK to generate a proof `SHA256(m) = 0`
        * I will use the proof with message m and satisfy the property to verify that I know m

* zk-SNARK
    * Example
        * As per SNARK, however:
            * I don't want to reveal m to a verifier
            * I will use the proof with message m to satisfies the property to verify that I know m without revealing why the message m satisfies it or what the message m is 

### Prerequisite Knowledge <a id="know"></a>

#### Arithmetic Circuits

* Arithmetic Circuits with Prime numbers
    * Given a prime number `p > 2`
    * With a "Prime" Finite Field, set `F = { 0, ..., p - 1 }`
    * Use addition, multiplication modulo p operations
    * Define an Arithmetic Circuits on top of the Field
        * Where Arithmetic Circuits `C: Fn -> F` are DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs) where internal nodes (gates) that are labelled with an arithmetic operation (e.g. `+, -, *`), and inputs are the input labels and the constant of 1 (e.g. `1, x1, ..., xn`) as shown [here](https://youtu.be/h-94UhJLeck?t=451). Evaluation of the Arithmetic Circuit defines a n-variate polynomial with an evaluation recipe (e.g. `x1 * (x1 + x1 + 1) * (x2 - 1)`)
        * Where size of the Arithmetic Circuits equals the amount of gates `|C| = # gates levels in C`

* Arithmetic Circuits with Hashing
    * `Chash(h, m): outputs 0 iff SHA256(m) = h, else /= 0`
        * Where `h` (hash value), `m` (hash input `m`)
        * Implementation: `Chash(h, m): (h - SHA256(m)), |Chash| ~= 20K gates`

* Verification Circuit of a Signature
    * `Csig(pk, m, s): outputs 0 if s is valid ECDSA signature on m with respect to pk`
        * Where `pk` (public key), `m` (message), `s` (signature)

#### Argument Systems (for NP-problems)

##### What is an Argument System

* Arithmetic Circuit is Public
    * `C(x, w) -> F`
        * Where `C` is circuit
        * Where `x` (input) is public statement in `Fn`
        * Where `w` (input) is secret Witness in `Fm`
        * Where `F` is output element in Finite Field
        * note: Inputs `x` and `w` could be tuples or multiple elements
    * Prover
        * Inputs know `x` and `w`
        * Goal is to convince Verifier `V` there exists a Witness `ÆŽw` of `C(x, w) = 0` by interacting until Accept/Reject statement
    * Verifier
        * Inputs known `x`
        * Does not know the Witness

##### Types of Argument Systems

### Build <a id="build"></a>

### Use Cases <a id="use-cases"></a>

* Private Tx (not reveal sender or amount)
* Solvency (chain provide private proof of solvency without revealing internal operations, anyone may verify proof is correct)
* Compliance (only reveal tx that are over US$10k to try to keep user data private)
* Taxes (proof that shows the amount of tax we submitted is consistent with the amount of tx we performed on-chain so not necessary to reveal finances to third-parties)
* Scalability (rollup systems where multiple tx processed in a batch then generate a proof that all tx are valid with only the proof posted on the blockchain, and verifiers on-chain only need to verify that the proof itself is correct, not all the individual tx)

### Real-World Usage <a id="real"></a>

* Blockchains with ZK Tx
    * Ethereum
        * Tornado Cash
    * Zcash
    * Iron Fish
    * Webb

    * Note: Anyone may verify that rules are being followed if public

* DApps with ZK
    * Aleo (run app, verify run correct, but with private code, private data, private interactors)
    * EZKL
